# Face and eyes detection using opencv
In this project, my goal is to detect faces and eyes within a given image. I aimed to practice my OpenCV skills through this task.

#### Pretrained models:
In these two files, you'll find pretrained models for eye and face detection, which I used in this problem:
- haarcascade_eye_tree_eyeglasses.xml
- haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

#### Preprocessing :
Before detection, I always convert the image to grayscale because it reduces complexity and enhances detection accuracy.


#### Result:
I saved result of detection in 'besiktas2.jpg' file.
